# MegaETH Tools

Tiny scripts I plan to use while testing the MegaETH **testnet**:
- Check a wallet balance via public endpoints
- Keep a simple faucet/tx log locally
- (Future) Ping realtime endpoints when publicly available

> Reference materials:
> - Official Docs (Architecture, Realtime API, Mini vs EVM Blocks): https://docs.megaeth.com/
> - Testnet portal: https://testnet.megaeth.com/

> Notes:
> - MegaETH positions itself as “real-time Ethereum” (very low latency, high throughput).
> - I’ll keep scripts minimal and beginner-friendly.
